## **Commands to run before pushing code**

After you commit all your changes, run these commands and commit the changes for these commands before pushing the code to the repository.

### **First Command**

```bash
npm run format:write
```

This command formats the code properly with proper indentation and spacing so that the code is easier to read.

### **Second Command**

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

This command displays any errors in the code. After running this command, you will get a list of errors and warnings. <br />
You can ignore the warnings, but if you get any error, it will provide the suggested fix for that error. <br />
Then, fix the error and push your code finally!

### **Third Command**

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

This command displays any issues (if present) within the code.

<br />

## **Updates**

Whenever you push some major changes or fix any issue, mention the changes briefly in this section and also add the file name/path where the changes were made. <br/>

If this section has some updates written, don't clear them. Just add your changes after that.

- Add points like this in a list format ( override this point to get started and add a `-` to make any point a list).
  <br/>
